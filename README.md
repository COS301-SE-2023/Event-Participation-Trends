## Indlovu - Gendac - Event Participation Trends

Event Participation Trends is a system that leverages the always-online nature of devices to track the number of people attending an event, generate heatmaps and flowmaps of the event, and provide a live feed of the event to the public.

The wireless sensors connect in a mesh-like topology to feed RSSI data to a wireless gateway. The gateway then sends the data to a server, which triangulates the position of the devices to generate the heatmaps and flowmaps and estimate the number of people attending the event.

The system uses Google Authentication to ensure security and privacy of the data and enforces role-based access control to ensure that only authorised users can access the data.
